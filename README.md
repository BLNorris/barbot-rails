Welcome to Barbot on Rails
======

Barbot is a robotic drink mixing machine, 

BARBOT was concieved and built in the two days leading up to New Year's Eve 2013. After two long nights of work, the bot came to life hours before the New Year's party it was built for. It was of course a big hit.

This, unfortunately, did not leave time to develop a proper UI for it. However, now that I am becoming an actual web developer, I thought it was time for an upgrade. Thus, the BARBOT interface was born.
